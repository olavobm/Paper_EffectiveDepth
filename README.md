The repositoy Paper_EffectiveDepth has the code to analyze data and generate figures for the scientific paper entitled "An Effective Water Depth Correction for Pressure-Based Wave Statistics on Rough Bathymetry", currently in review for the Journal of Atmospheric and Oceanic Technology (JTECH).
At the top directory level, this GitHub repository has:
* data_proc: a directory with Matlab code to analyze the data.
* figures: a directory with Matlab code to generate the figures, along with the figures in the paper.
* paper_directory.m: a function that returns the paper directory path.
* run_all.m: a high-level script that runs all the code for the analysis and figures.


The data has been archived in Zenodo. To reproduce the analysis, save the data repository next to the content in the Paper_EffectiveDepth GitHub repository.
To reproduce the figures, you must also have [cmocean](https://github.com/chadagreene/cmocean) for a few colormaps.

For using the repository, **first edit the directory path in paper_directory.m** to reflect the appropriate paper repository folder.
After editing paper_directory.m, you may run the full analysis with run_all.m. This script simply runs the other high-level scripts ~/data_proc/run_alldataprocessing.m and ~/figures/run_allfigures.m.
